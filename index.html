            <p>
                Alpha Kappa Rho (AKR) Fraternity and Sorority, also known as the Akrho, is a fraternity established in the Philippines. It was founded on October 4, 1973, at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, Philippines, by students led by late Bro. Salvador Lacsina Jr.
    
                The fraternity was established with the core principles of promoting camaraderie, brotherhood, academic excellence, and service to the community. Over the years, AKR has played a significant role in shaping the lives of its members, providing them with opportunities for personal growth, leadership development, and social responsibility.
    
                Since its founding, AKR has grown to become one of the largest and most influential fraternities in the Philippines, with chapters and members across the country and even abroad. The fraternity has been actively involved in various community service projects, charitable activities, and advocacies aimed at making a positive impact on society.
